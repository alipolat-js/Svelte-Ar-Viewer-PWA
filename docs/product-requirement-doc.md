   - Auto-scaling configuration
   - Load balancing with AWS ALB

2. Storage
   - S3 for model storage
   - RDS for PostgreSQL
   - ElastiCache for Redis

3. Security
   - AWS KMS for encryption
   - WAF for security
   - CloudFront for CDN
   - AWS Shield for DDoS protection

4. Monitoring
   - CloudWatch for logging
   - X-Ray for tracing
   - Custom metrics for AR performance

## Security Measures
- End-to-end encryption for data transmission
- Model encryption at rest
- Secure token management
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Security headers implementation
